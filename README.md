# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Project Description

This is a side project that I did in order to further develop my skills in Microsoft Excel and create a product that provides real value to a business owner. I made an interactive dashboard using sales data from an online coffee bean distributor. With this dashboard, stakeholders will be able to easily identify key performance indicators such as sales over time, sales by country, and top customers. In addition, the sliders allow you to filter for time, roast type, loyalty card membership, and order size.

To clean the data, I removed duplicate entries, applied an intuitive naming scheme for fields and records, created calculated fields, and consolidated relevant information from three different sheets into one. 

Some of the key functions I applied in this project were: Xlookup, Index Match, Nested IF statements, and Pivot Tables.
